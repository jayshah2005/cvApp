# CV Builder Application

A dynamic resume builder built with React and TypeScript that allows users to create, edit, and preview professional CVs in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of CV changes as you type
- **Dynamic Sections**: Add, edit, and remove education, work experience, and project entries
- **Date Management**: Integrated date pickers for accurate timeline tracking
- **Bullet Points**: Dynamic bullet point management for work experience and projects
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, professional layout using Material-UI components

## Technologies Used

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for component library and theming
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Day.js** for date handling and formatting

## What I Learned

- **Component Architecture**: Designed reusable, modular components for input and output sections
- **State Management**: Managed complex nested state structures (arrays of objects with nested arrays)
- **TypeScript**: Applied type safety throughout the application
- **Material-UI Integration**: Implemented MUI components including DatePicker with proper date handling
- **Data Normalization**: Refactored data structures to a standardized format (title/subtitle) for consistency
- **Template Pattern**: Created reusable template functions for generating new entries
